User Stories 

This app is everyone who doesn't like to carry around obnoxious notebooks just to track their workouts/progress. Brawnzy handles all of that for you.

If you're out of town and don't know the area too well but still want to get a workout, the nearme feature will search for gyms around you based on your location.
